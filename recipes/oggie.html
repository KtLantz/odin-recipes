    <h2>Description</h2>
 
 
    <p>The Oggie is the Welsh equivalent of a Cornish Pasty, which is basically a British empanada. In both Cornwall and Wales, the savory handheld pastries
        were given to miners to eat on the job when they couldn't make it topside for lunch. One legend has it that "It is said the mark of a good oggie/pasty was surviving being
        dropped down a mine shaft." </p>
    <p>Unlike the <em>empanada</em> however, instead of beef or pork, the oggie is traditionally filled with lamb and leeks.</p>
